# ad-server-kargo
This is a solution to the following interview exercise [excerpt]:

...The Ad Server should be built based on a REST API, and should support the following core functionality:

- Ability to save new ad creatives in the database that can be retrieved later on.
- Ability to serve an ad creative based on request criteria (see below for more details)

Ad servers can vary in complexity and supported features. For the purposes of this exercise, the Ad Server will be very basic, but should at a minimum, be able to 
- differentiate between ads of different formats, 
- determine which ad to show based on the current date.
